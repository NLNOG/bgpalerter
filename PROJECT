Project goals
=============


1/ script without webui, that mimics the bgpmon functionality
   use the bgpmon yaml configuration file as input

other ideas:

- API to retrieve a list of current (or past) alerts, or clear alerts

- some autodiscovery, the script can detect in which ASN it is running, it can then recommend a list of things to monitor
  we want to get to the point where you can launch the script ala './script -m noc@organisation.net' and be done

- webui with accounts, where people can sign up in the hosted version
  anyone can indicate interest in monitoring any resource, we don't need
  to figure out who owns what.

- make a "BIRD to RIS Live" converter so interact with the NLNOG Looking Glass
  so that we have a backup for the "RIS Live" backup.
